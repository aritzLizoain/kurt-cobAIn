wavs/01-untitled|It's gone.
wavs/02-untitled|I've finally been prescribed the right stomach medicine after six years of being in constant pain.
wavs/03-untitled|Finally I haven't had a stomach problem for like over a year now.
wavs/04-untitled|No they never figured out what it was I mean.
wavs/05-untitled|Most gastrointestinal doctors don't know anything about stomach diseases.
wavs/06-untitled|They just have a PhD you know.
wavs/07-untitled|They get payed a lot of money for pretending and prescribing you different drugs.
wavs/08-untitled|It's it's a total scam as far as I am concerned.
wavs/09-untitled|I've been going to doctors for six years.
wavs/10-untitled|And I've tried every drug available.
wavs/11-untitled|Except for this one last one it's brand new and it finally worked.
wavs/12-untitled|It isn't a s specific stomach ailment it doesn't have a name or anything.
wavs/13-untitled|It wasn't a matter of finding out what disease I had.
wavs/14-untitled|That's the common term that all doctors call a stomach problem.
wavs/15-untitled|And eventually heal them but I didn't have an ulcer I just had a red irritation on my stomach.
wavs/16-untitled|But I was in pain I mean I was.
wavs/17-untitled|In pain for so long that I didn't care if I was in a band I didn't care if I was alive you know.
wavs/18-untitled|That I was you know suicidal I mean I just didn't wanna live.
wavs/19-untitled|I just thought if I'm gonna die if I'm gonna kill myself I should take some drug.
wavs/20-untitled|I guess I'll become a junkie cause I felt like a junkie every day.
