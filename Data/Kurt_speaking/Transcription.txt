wavs/01-untitled.wav|It's gone.
wavs/02-untitled.wav|I've finally been prescribed the right stomach medicine after six years of being in constant pain.
wavs/03-untitled.wav|Finally I haven't had a stomach problem for like over a year now.
wavs/04-untitled.wav|No they never figured out what it was I mean.
wavs/05-untitled.wav|Most gastrointestinal doctors don't know anything about stomach diseases.
wavs/06-untitled.wav|They just have a PhD you know.
wavs/07-untitled.wav|They get payed a lot of money for pretending and prescribing you different drugs.
wavs/08-untitled.wav|It's it's a total scam as far as I am concerned.
wavs/09-untitled.wav|I've been going to doctors for six years.
wavs/10-untitled.wav|And I've tried every drug available.
wavs/11-untitled.wav|Except for this one last one it's brand new and it finally worked.
wavs/12-untitled.wav|It isn't a s specific stomach ailment it doesn't have a name or anything.
wavs/13-untitled.wav|It wasn't a matter of finding out what disease I had.
wavs/14-untitled.wav|That's the common term that all doctors call a stomach problem.
wavs/15-untitled.wav|And eventually heal them but I didn't have an ulcer I just had a red irritation on my stomach.
wavs/16-untitled.wav|But I was in pain I mean I was.
wavs/17-untitled.wav|In pain for so long that I didn't care if I was in a band I didn't care if I was alive you know.
wavs/18-untitled.wav|That I was you know suicidal I mean I just didn't wanna live.
wavs/19-untitled.wav|I just thought if I'm gonna die if I'm gonna kill myself I should take some drug.
wavs/20-untitled.wav|I guess I'll become a junkie cause I felt like a junkie every day.
wavs/21-untitled.wav|You know, waking up starving.
wavs/22-untitled.wav|Forcing myself to eat.
wavs/23-untitled.wav|Just imagine trying to eat.
wavs/24-untitled.wav|Just concentrating and just.
wavs/25-untitled.wav|I'm in pain all the time.
wavs/26-untitled.wav|And being on tour was a lot worse.
wavs/27-untitled.wav|About a year ago.
wavs/28-untitled.wav|Yeah, I mean it although it worked.
wavs/29-untitled.wav|I mean, I like the video, overall.
wavs/30-untitled.wav|It wasn't what I pictured in my mind, when I come up with an idea for a video, I want it.
wavs/31-untitled.wav|To be translated exactly how I see it in my mind.
wavs/32-untitled.wav|We didn't take enough time.
wavs/33-untitled.wav|We didn't prepare ourselves.
wavs/34-untitled.wav|I just remember waking in the day of the shoot.
wavs/35-untitled.wav|I told them what I wanted, I drew pictures of it, and I walked in and it wasn't what I wanted.
wavs/36-untitled.wav|Still the kids made the video.
wavs/37-untitled.wav|And I had to like.
wavs/38-untitled.wav|There was a lot of really good footage.
wavs/39-untitled.wav|So I just threw all the spontaneous parts in.
wavs/40-untitled.wav|Yeah, those were the biggest things.
wavs/41-untitled.wav|Baby underwater.
wavs/42-untitled.wav|Overall I'd say.
wavs/43-untitled.wav|Exactly how I thought of it in my mind.
wavs/44-untitled.wav|He came up with the idea.
wavs/45-untitled.wav|It's great to work with somebody that.
wavs/46-untitled.wav|Can come up with their own ideas too.
wavs/47-untitled.wav|And just surprise you.
wavs/48-untitled.wav|Not only come up with the same exact vision that you have.
wavs/49-untitled.wav|Translate that.
wavs/50-untitled.wav|And then throwing their own ideas.
wavs/51-untitled.wav|And that works even better.
wavs/52-untitled.wav|Because then you have more things to work with.
wavs/53-untitled.wav|Quite a few hours.
wavs/54-untitled.wav|Yeah.
wavs/55-untitled.wav|We failed to.
wavs/56-untitled.wav|Hire.
wavs/57-untitled.wav|Puppet people.
wavs/58-untitled.wav|Who do animation.
wavs/59-untitled.wav|To get it out in time.
wavs/60-untitled.wav|Actually we just put it on hold.
wavs/61-untitled.wav|We're still working on it.
wavs/62-untitled.wav|We still wanna do something with puppets.
wavs/63-untitled.wav|Dolls, I've been making dolls for years.
wavs/64-untitled.wav|The dolls that I make.
wavs/65-untitled.wav|That's my mind, you know.
wavs/66-untitled.wav|We're still working on it.
wavs/67-untitled.wav|It is such a rip-off, it's it's a shameless rip-off.
wavs/68-untitled.wav|That was terrible.
wavs/69-untitled.wav|It's a neat video, it's really nice to look at.
wavs/70-untitled.wav|Oh shameless.
wavs/71-untitled.wav|It was my idea.
wavs/72-untitled.wav|I wanna do a video.
wavs/73-untitled.wav|Something that looked like it was off of live television.
wavs/74-untitled.wav|And I thought.
wavs/75-untitled.wav|The best way to do it.
wavs/76-untitled.wav|Instead of trying to reproduce.
