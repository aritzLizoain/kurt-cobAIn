wavs/01-untitled.wav|It's gone.
wavs/02-untitled.wav|I've finally been prescribed the right stomach medicine after six years of being in constant pain.
wavs/03-untitled.wav|Finally I haven't had a stomach problem for like over a year now.
wavs/04-untitled.wav|No they never figured out what it was I mean.
wavs/05-untitled.wav|Most gastrointestinal doctors don't know anything about stomach diseases.
wavs/06-untitled.wav|They just have a PhD you know.
wavs/07-untitled.wav|They get payed a lot of money for pretending and prescribing you different drugs.
wavs/08-untitled.wav|It's it's a total scam as far as I am concerned.
wavs/09-untitled.wav|I've been going to doctors for six years.
wavs/10-untitled.wav|And I've tried every drug available.
wavs/11-untitled.wav|Except for this one last one it's brand new and it finally worked.
wavs/12-untitled.wav|It isn't a s specific stomach ailment it doesn't have a name or anything.
wavs/13-untitled.wav|It wasn't a matter of finding out what disease I had.
wavs/14-untitled.wav|That's the common term that all doctors call a stomach problem.
wavs/15-untitled.wav|And eventually heal them but I didn't have an ulcer I just had a red irritation on my stomach.
wavs/16-untitled.wav|But I was in pain I mean I was.
wavs/17-untitled.wav|In pain for so long that I didn't care if I was in a band I didn't care if I was alive you know.
wavs/18-untitled.wav|That I was you know suicidal I mean I just didn't wanna live.
wavs/19-untitled.wav|I just thought if I'm gonna die if I'm gonna kill myself I should take some drug.
wavs/20-untitled.wav|I guess I'll become a junkie cause I felt like a junkie every day.
wavs/21-untitled.wav|You know, waking up starving.
wavs/22-untitled.wav|Forcing myself to eat.
wavs/23-untitled.wav|Just imagine trying to eat.
wavs/24-untitled.wav|Just concentrating and just.
wavs/25-untitled.wav|I'm in pain all the time.
wavs/26-untitled.wav|And being on tour was a lot worse.
wavs/27-untitled.wav|About a year ago.
wavs/28-untitled.wav|Yeah, I mean it although it worked.
wavs/29-untitled.wav|I mean, I like the video, overall.
wavs/30-untitled.wav|It wasn't what I pictured in my mind, when I come up with an idea for a video, I want it.
wavs/31-untitled.wav|To be translated exactly how I see it in my mind.
wavs/32-untitled.wav|We didn't take enough time.
wavs/33-untitled.wav|We didn't prepare ourselves.
wavs/34-untitled.wav|I just remember waking in the day of the shoot.
wavs/35-untitled.wav|I told them what I wanted, I drew pictures of it, and I walked in and it wasn't what I wanted.
wavs/36-untitled.wav|Still the kids made the video.
wavs/37-untitled.wav|And I had to like.
wavs/38-untitled.wav|There was a lot of really good footage.
wavs/39-untitled.wav|So I just threw all the spontaneous parts in.
wavs/40-untitled.wav|Yeah, those were the biggest things.
wavs/41-untitled.wav|Baby underwater.
wavs/42-untitled.wav|Overall I'd say.
wavs/43-untitled.wav|Exactly how I thought of it in my mind.
wavs/44-untitled.wav|He came up with the idea.
wavs/45-untitled.wav|It's great to work with somebody that.
wavs/46-untitled.wav|Can come up with their own ideas too.
wavs/47-untitled.wav|And just surprise you.
wavs/48-untitled.wav|Not only come up with the same exact vision that you have.
wavs/49-untitled.wav|Translate that.
wavs/50-untitled.wav|And then throwing their own ideas.
wavs/51-untitled.wav|And that works even better.
wavs/52-untitled.wav|Because then you have more things to work with.
wavs/53-untitled.wav|Quite a few hours.
wavs/54-untitled.wav|Yeah.
wavs/55-untitled.wav|We failed to.
wavs/56-untitled.wav|Hire.
wavs/57-untitled.wav|Puppet people.
wavs/58-untitled.wav|Who do animation.
wavs/59-untitled.wav|To get it out in time.
wavs/60-untitled.wav|Actually we just put it on hold.
wavs/61-untitled.wav|We're still working on it.
wavs/62-untitled.wav|We still wanna do something with puppets.
wavs/63-untitled.wav|Dolls, I've been making dolls for years.
wavs/64-untitled.wav|The dolls that I make.
wavs/65-untitled.wav|That's my mind, you know.
wavs/66-untitled.wav|We're still working on it.
wavs/67-untitled.wav|It is such a rip-off, it's it's a shameless rip-off.
wavs/68-untitled.wav|That was terrible.
wavs/69-untitled.wav|It's a neat video, it's really nice to look at.
wavs/70-untitled.wav|Oh shameless.
wavs/71-untitled.wav|It was my idea.
wavs/72-untitled.wav|I wanna do a video.
wavs/73-untitled.wav|Something that looked like it was off of live television.
wavs/74-untitled.wav|And I thought.
wavs/75-untitled.wav|The best way to do it.
wavs/76-untitled.wav|Instead of trying to reproduce.
wavs/77-untitled.wav|That effect with new film I thought.
wavs/78-untitled.wav|Camera still available.
wavs/79-untitled.wav|It just worked out perfectly.
wavs/80-untitled.wav|I didn't think we'd ever be able to actually find those kind of cameras.
wavs/81-untitled.wav|We did.
wavs/82-untitled.wav|And that's another video that just came out exactly how I wanted it.
wavs/83-untitled.wav|Just perfectly.
wavs/84-untitled.wav|No, I don't remember.
wavs/85-untitled.wav|I was taking to Kevin about it and I said that I'd like.
wavs/86-untitled.wav|Him to say something about how nice.
wavs/87-untitled.wav|How perfectly.
wavs/88-untitled.wav|Us being thought of as degenerates.
wavs/89-untitled.wav|We needed a light hearted video.
wavs/90-untitled.wav|Was there a third one.
wavs/91-untitled.wav|I don't know anything.
wavs/92-untitled.wav|All suits, I think Kevin wanted to do one.
wavs/93-untitled.wav|With just suits.
wavs/94-untitled.wav|I never.
wavs/95-untitled.wav|I've never seen that one.
wavs/96-untitled.wav|I don't know if he actually made one or not.
wavs/97-untitled.wav|It turned out that.
wavs/98-untitled.wav|It looks a lot like my old apartment in Olympia.
wavs/99-untitled.wav| My entire apartment.
wavs/100-untitled.wav|All the stuff from my apartment in Olympia.
wavs/101-untitled.wav|Stored in a storage space for the last two years.
wavs/102-untitled.wav|Brought it up to the house we moved in Seattle last year.
wavs/103-untitled.wav|And I had all the stuff in the basement so I set everything up exactly how I had it in my apartment.
wavs/104-untitled.wav|In the middle of us dancing around throwing things.
wavs/105-untitled.wav|We we shot us dancing around and then we put her down and then.
wavs/106-untitled.wav|She was there us babysitting. 
wavs/107-untitled.wav|We met him a few months.
wavs/108-untitled.wav|Before we we did the video.
wavs/109-untitled.wav|Of before we decided to do the video.
wavs/110-untitled.wav|He was just such a nice guy and then I saw.
wavs/111-untitled.wav|Work with somebody that was a photographer or an artist.
wavs/112-untitled.wav|Make sure the visuals where gonna be really stark and vivid.
wavs/113-untitled.wav|Yeah he's great.
wavs/114-untitled.wav|All of it was my idea, except for the large woman.
wavs/115-untitled.wav|And that was just another thing that he just threw in.
wavs/116-untitled.wav|We didn't even talk about that.
wavs/117-untitled.wav|He's incredible.
wavs/118-untitled.wav|Like I was saying before, it's really great to work with somebody has their own ideas.
wavs/119-untitled.wav|And not only can he translate exactly.
wavs/120-untitled.wav|That video.
wavs/121-untitled.wav|Has come closer to what I've seen in my mind.
wavs/122-untitled.wav|A lot of work yeah.
wavs/123-untitled.wav|It's so fragile.
wavs/124-untitled.wav|I've been on tour.
wavs/125-untitled.wav|I haven't been thinking of anything other than just concentrating on touring.
wavs/126-untitled.wav|I don't really see the need to put out.
wavs/127-untitled.wav|Basically a waste of money.
wavs/128-untitled.wav|Everyone knows we have a record out.
wavs/129-untitled.wav|And if we are going to sell.
wavs/130-untitled.wav|Then those aren't people who wanna listen to our album anyhow, they bought it because of that video or that song.
wavs/131-untitled.wav|I just wanna sell albums to people who really like us and who already know about us and already like us.
wavs/132-untitled.wav|I actually don't wanna do any more videos.
wavs/133-untitled.wav|I've got a few ideas for for rape me.
wavs/134-untitled.wav|We wanna release it as single.
wavs/135-untitled.wav|I don't think it was the best performance of the unplugged thing.
wavs/136-untitled.wav|It could work really well acoustically. 
wavs/137-untitled.wav|I think it had a little bit to do with that.
wavs/138-untitled.wav|We just wanted to make sure that it wasn't.
wavs/139-untitled.wav|The main reason is.
wavs/140-untitled.wav|Had nothing to do with wanting to alienate people.
wavs/141-untitled.wav|Exactly, how we, wanted.
wavs/142-untitled.wav|That we would listen to, at home.
wavs/143-untitled.wav|Bands that are produced the way Nevermind was produced.
wavs/144-untitled.wav|Although it is raw by comparison.
wavs/145-untitled.wav|To most other commercial rock records.
wavs/146-untitled.wav|We don't listen to that kind of music.
wavs/147-untitled.wav|I mean I really can't think of any band besides R.E.M. that, that has that kind of production that I like.
wavs/148-untitled.wav|But we couldn't afford it at the time.
wavs/149-untitled.wav|I'm sure Steve has done bands for nothing.
wavs/150-untitled.wav|We just didn't think he would like us.
wavs/151-untitled.wav|That's what I thought too, I just thought it was the perfect sound for us.
wavs/152-untitled.wav|That's exactly.
wavs/153-untitled.wav|How I want my band to sound, that's how I've always wanted our band to sound but we've never been able to capture that sound.
wavs/154-untitled.wav|It was just a coincidence.
wavs/155-untitled.wav|He produces records like that.
wavs/156-untitled.wav|He's not much of a vocal man.
wavs/157-untitled.wav|And we're a very vocal-oriented band so, it was kind of a struggle to get the vocals loud enough.
wavs/158-untitled.wav|We're always asking him to turn the vocals up more.
wavs/159-untitled.wav|We listened to In Utero for about two months after it was finished.
wavs/160-untitled.wav|Listening to this the album over and over again it got a bit redundant.
wavs/161-untitled.wav|That drum sound is a bit overburying after a while and so we didn't want the entire album to sound like that.
wavs/162-untitled.wav|We wanted something different.
wavs/163-untitled.wav|I mean he's one of the greatest people I've ever worked with, I mean he's so easy to work with.
wavs/164-untitled.wav|I think we all wanna do our next record with him.
wavs/165-untitled.wav|He came up with.
wavs/166-untitled.wav|He came up with the drum part first and then.
wavs/167-untitled.wav|I came up with all the other guitar things over the top of it.
wavs/168-untitled.wav|That'd be great if Krist and Dave could write more songs.
wavs/169-untitled.wav|Affected the band other than.
wavs/170-untitled.wav|She amuses everybody backstage when she's on tour with us.
wavs/171-untitled.wav|Everyone loves to have her around.
wavs/172-untitled.wav|I don't know since I haven't had a stomach problem and I've had a child, I'm married now.
wavs/173-untitled.wav|I'm sure I'm a lot easier to deal with.
wavs/174-untitled.wav|I'm not as grumpy as I used to be.
wavs/175-untitled.wav|Now there are no bad thoughts about one another behind each other's backs.
wavs/176-untitled.wav|At all.
wavs/177-untitled.wav|I couldn't be happier right now.
wavs/178-untitled.wav|I think I've just become more comfortable with them.
wavs/179-untitled.wav|And I'm just a bit more proud of them.
wavs/180-untitled.wav|It was important for me to have everyone read the lyrics for this album because.
wavs/181-untitled.wav|Although no one wants to believe it I went out of my way to not put very much of my personal life into it.
wavs/182-untitled.wav|I specially focused on not.
wavs/183-untitled.wav|Writing about.
wavs/184-untitled.wav|And it turns out that there are maybe one or two lines in the song here and there.
wavs/185-untitled.wav|Could be thought of as something that the relates to my past life.
wavs/186-untitled.wav|I read a few reviews.
wavs/187-untitled.wav|People went completely overboard.
wavs/188-untitled.wav|My favorite insight source.
wavs/189-untitled.wav|The song is about rape, right, but that one line doesn't mean that that song is about me, it isn't because, it isn't about me being raped my the media or anything.
wavs/190-untitled.wav|But because that one line is in there, a lot of people thought that that's what the song is about.
wavs/191-untitled.wav|Then the rest of the lyrics don't have anything to do with the band.
wavs/192-untitled.wav|What was the question again.
wavs/193-untitled.wav|The first opening lines.
wavs/194-untitled.wav|That is certainly about.
wavs/195-untitled.wav|My ideas about grunge rock and and what I've experienced in the last few years. 
wavs/196-untitled.wav|Rest of the song isn't about that at all, it completely changes the subject.
wavs/197-untitled.wav|We did the Rolling Stone cover story.
wavs/198-untitled.wav|I guess that's what I could say.
wavs/199-untitled.wav|Also there is just so many misconceptions and so many stupid rumors that I we all just got tired of reading about it all the time. 
wavs/200-untitled.wav|Tell the truth about things.
wavs/201-untitled.wav|That should be interesting.
wavs/202-untitled.wav|We had absolutely no control over editing anything.
wavs/203-untitled.wav|He let me read it.
wavs/204-untitled.wav|Right before it went to print.
wavs/205-untitled.wav|He stood behind me looking over my shoulder as I read it.
wavs/206-untitled.wav|I don't even remember what I read, I mean if there inaccuracies, I wouldn't have been to tell them at the time anyhow.
wavs/207-untitled.wav|That's about as much control as we had over it.
wavs/208-untitled.wav|Did I think that they would use that photo on the cover.
wavs/209-untitled.wav|But I just didn't put it on, I just didn't bother to put it on.
wavs/210-untitled.wav|But I just wanted to make sure.
wavs/211-untitled.wav|To either wear one or the other, you know to wear one or the other shirts.
wavs/212-untitled.wav|And never to take my sunglasses off.
wavs/213-untitled.wav|Because I knew if I took my sunglasses off just once, that's the photo they would've used.
wavs/214-untitled.wav|I'm still concentrated on playing guitar, a lot more than I thought I would.
wavs/215-untitled.wav|I thought it would relieve me so much that I wouldn't even have to try anymore, and I could screw up notes and it wouldn't matter.
wavs/216-untitled.wav|I still hear myself screw up, so I still have to concentrate.
wavs/217-untitled.wav|Almost as much as I ever did before.
wavs/218-untitled.wav|It also just rounds up the sound.
wavs/219-untitled.wav|Hey, shut up.
wavs/220-untitled.wav|Who is that.
wavs/221-untitled.wav|What was the question now.
wavs/222-untitled.wav|I know the leads.
wavs/223-untitled.wav|Well, actually I don't.
wavs/224-untitled.wav|I mean even till this day, I still haven't bothered to learn the solo that I recorded on the album. 
wavs/225-untitled.wav|I just play whatever I want.
wavs/226-untitled.wav|It was never anything even close to official, we just decided to try him out one day.
wavs/227-untitled.wav|Since we like him, and that's one of the most important things when you get a new band member.
wavs/228-untitled.wav|If they play good music then, that's second.
wavs/229-untitled.wav|Something we've been wanting for a while.
wavs/230-untitled.wav|Then we found ourselves without a guitar tech.
wavs/231-untitled.wav|We haven't tried writing any songs together yet.
wavs/232-untitled.wav|Probably never.
wavs/233-untitled.wav|I don't know.
wavs/234-untitled.wav|I doesn't affect us anymore, so I don't really think about it.
wavs/235-untitled.wav|I'm sure it's a curse to a lot of other bands.
wavs/236-untitled.wav|It's probably an embarrassment, for some people.
wavs/237-untitled.wav|It was a long distance recording.
wavs/238-untitled.wav|He had recorded his vocals.
wavs/239-untitled.wav|A few weeks later, at the last minute I decided to record my guitar part.
wavs/240-untitled.wav|And then I just sent it to them and let them edit it.
wavs/241-untitled.wav|Yeah he said, good job, yeah I liked it.
wavs/242-untitled.wav|I think the record company that put it out.
wavs/243-untitled.wav|Likes to use both of our names.
